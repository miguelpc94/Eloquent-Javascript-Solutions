# Eloquent-Javascript-Solutions
The solutions for the exercises in the book Eloquent Javascript, coded my way.

Each file is the complete solution for an exercise. You'll find the file names in the following format: x_y_filename, where x is the chapter and y is the exercise number. Inside the code I'll provide comments for what was required in the exercise and comments explaining what I've done ( Only do it when I'm in a good mood - happens once in a while :P ).
